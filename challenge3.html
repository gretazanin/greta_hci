<h4>BUDDY AND COZMO</h4>
  <p> Buddy: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Z3kwsUjrbo&vl=en"> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Z3kwsUjrbo&vl=en</a>

  Cozmo: <a target="_blank" href="https://anki.com/en-us/cozmo.html"> https://anki.com/en-us/cozmo.html</a>

Both Buddy and Cozmo are emotional robots that behave humanly and show affections through facial expressions, movements, words. <br><br>
They’re both considered as toys but aim at also engaging adults and elderly people with the multiple functions which are adaptable to diverse sectors: food recipes, music playing, social media forecast, general calls and messaging system, alarm system, games, chasing ability and face recognition. <br><br>
They can easily replace a pet for their playful attitude, but they’re also useful and mind opening for the young ones who have interest in technology and robotics.

<h4>ANIMATRONICS – Luxo Jr at Pixar Place</h4>
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHY5kpGTsDE"> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHY5kpGTsDE </a>
<br>
<p>Animatronics is a term used to describe mechatronic puppets. They’re mainly used in theme parks and animation movies and Pixar has greatly proved how these artificial creatures can become extremely popular. 
Luxo Jr is the famous lamp that appears at every intro of a Pixar movie. Its popularity grew so big that it even became part of Disney’s Hollywood Studios, a theme park in the US. <br>
What I love about this is how technology makes this object “human” and sympathetic, which inspires me in creating something relatable to humans but still unreal.

Cellular automata is a system consisted of cells which move within a grid according to their neighbour cells. The atom dynamics evolve through the grid, forming endless options of movement in the space. This technique is often used for artworks or multimedia projects.  <br><br>

video:<a target="_blank" href="https://softologyblog.wordpress.com/2019/12/28/3d-cellular-automata-3/"> https://softologyblog.wordpress.com/2019/12/28/3d-cellular-automata-3/</a></p>

       <p>Here in the link above, it’s explained how to apply Cellular Automata into 3D space, and how the rules work. It’s fairly based on “Game of Life”, although it’s upgraded to 3D, while John Conway’s creation was 2D. <br><br>
I find Cellular Automata mesmerizing and extremely eye-catching as it resembles life with its birth, survival and death state of cells’ life. I’d love to try out something in this field, although it looks as complex as fascinating.

      <h4>	DEMO 1: REALITY COMPOSER - WEIRD LOOKING BUDDY </h4>      
      
      <p>
I was curious to see whether it’s possible to create AR or VR content on the iPad. I found out about Reality Composer, a tool that allows users to insert already made assets or even create new ones by scratch and placing them in the virtual space. 
I decided to generate a creature by using simple shapes. I made it weird looking and I made it move its lips whenever interacted with. 
Here are videos and screenshots of the process: 
</p>

</p>

<p> The software is very striaghtforward and nice to use. I enjoyed creating something from scratch and seeing it getting alive step after step. It was also nice to find a lot of useful material online that provided me with the notions I needed to create an interactive character. 

<br><br> 

<h4>DEMO 2: MOODY PLANT</h4>
           <p> At this point, I wanted to see how an already existing object could be turned into an artificial creature. </p>

           <video width="300" height="300" controls>

</video> 
 
<p>For the second demo, I used Arduino, matrix display and potentiometer to give my tint plant a personality. By spinning the potentiometer, the screen changes from sad face to happy one. 
To make the display fit in the vase, I cut a square on its surface. 
Finally, I made a video that shows how the plant becomes happy after been taken care of.

            <a target="_blank" href="images/challenge3/plant2.png"><img src="images/challenge3/plant2.png" height="300" > </a>
            </p>
    
<p>I think it's interesting to see how a plant can embody a real character when provided with a facial expression. I think this demo is relevant to show how diverse and versatile technology is and how anything can be used for this purpose.</p>



<h4>DEMO 3: TRYING OUT </h4>
   
   <p>At this point, I wanted to strongly challenge myself and I started looking for useful material about Cellular Automata. <br> I was so impressed during my research phase that I thought I could give it a try and make something cool with it. <br> I didn't take into consideration that it would have been way more difficult than I imagined. <br> I found some good tutorials where it was explained how to apply the rules, but it was still a bit too hard for me to fully grasp the mechanism.</p>
   
   <p>I finally found a good source that explained how to incorporate Cellular Automata with Processing, creating an endless sequence of dots, lines, figures.</p>
   
   <p>This helped me creating something:
<br>

  <source src="images/challenge3/cell2.MOV" type="video/ogg">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video> </p>
          
      <p> The outcome is clearly faulty and my attempt to adapting the code to my preferences worked only partially. However, I was happy to see some characteristics such as the constant change of scenes, how one cell's action affects the next one and finally, I tried out different colors and I was happy to customize the code as much as possible.</p>

        <h3>THE MAGIC HAT</h3> 
        
                <p> CLick on the following link to check out my showcase on YouTube: </p> <a href="https://youtu.be/HzSPI2Ce9Y0">https://youtu.be/HzSPI2Ce9Y0</a>
                                  <br><br>
                                   
                                  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HzSPI2Ce9Y0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        
        
        <p> 
For this challenge I created a magic hat, which magically opens when its approached by needing hands. It’s made of cardboard and it’s composed of three main parts: the based made of an already existing fisherman hat, the main vertical structure made of thick cardboard and lastly the lid, which is made of a lighter cardboard and supported by a servomotor and duct tape. 
Arduino allows this hat to properly function by activating the servo motor only when a movement is detected by the proximity sensor. The lid stays open for around 8 seconds, enough time for the owner to be able to insert something and take her/his hands away from it before its closure. 
<br><br>
What motivated me to create this device was my late-stage research on wearables, which was focused on gadgets and innovative tech clothing. My final product can be seen as both functional and artsy object. 
</p>

    <br><br>
    
<p>I used Arduino and Arduino IDE to make my hat function as I wanted. Once imported the servo into my code, I determined the constant integer, the starting condition for the proximity sensor to be activated (10 cm), its duration and the delay which the servo would take into account before going back to its starting position (5 seconds)</p>

<p>Here I place the code:</p>

  <p>When I was little, I used to love the movie “Spy Kids”, a children action movie that made me dream of becoming a secret agent for years and years. I even forced my mother to buy me special glasses with a speaker incorporated, so that I could hear all the most secret conversations from the bathroom to the kitchen. <br><br> <img src="images/challenge2/spykid.jpg" height="200"> 
  
  <br><br>Growing up, also my love for tech gadgets grew bigger and I found out that I’m not alone in this tech wearable Fanclub. <br><br> I see wearables gaining acknowledgement all around the world and the feeling I get from this general acclamation is that wearable are future, and will overpass standard devices sooner than we imagine. <br> <br> While some wearables might be bulky and not aesthetically pleasing due to their technologic components, more and more companies are trying to achieve a good combination between useful, tech and fashionable/compelling to the sight, and I can’t wait to be wearing my books on my wrist, or possessing a ring with updated exams notes. 
            </p>
  <br> 
<p>
My product is a useful, fun, pretty (or at least I think so) wearable that kind of has its own personality. I think people would love to wear my magic hat, even to hang out with friends or going to festivals with it. It takes inspiration from wizard hats and its look is still very industrial. One could even choose to paint it with some extravagant patterns or choose to build it with a different shape. <br>
It could represent the new tech fashion wave: fashion wearable hats with a personality.
Additionally, I think the magic hat embodies the essence of wearables, as it’s innovative and useful. </p>

<br> 
<p>
Working on this hat was the most fun experience ever. Building its body by using cardboard, fabric, duct tape, Arduino and sensors (proximity and servo motor) was such a fun and cool experiment and although I had to ask for help to teachers more than once, I was super happy and proud with my final result. <br> I managed to adapt the knowledge from the workshops with some extra research and skills I gained during the tinkering phase. <br><br> It was very interesting to notice how creative I could be even if I only knew the basics of this technology. <br><br> I’m looking forward to collecting more sensors and tinkering with an even bigger variety of tools and possibilities.
