<h4>BUDDY AND COZMO</h4>
  <p> Buddy: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Z3kwsUjrbo&vl=en"> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Z3kwsUjrbo&vl=en</a>
  <br> 
  Cozmo: <a target="_blank" href="https://anki.com/en-us/cozmo.html"> https://anki.com/en-us/cozmo.html</a>

Both Buddy and Cozmo are emotional robots that behave humanly and show affections through facial expressions, movements, words. <br><br>
They’re both considered as toys but aim at also engaging adults and elderly people with the multiple functions which are adaptable to diverse sectors: food recipes, music playing, social media forecast, general calls and messaging system, alarm system, games, chasing ability and face recognition. <br><br>
They can easily replace a pet for their playful attitude, but they’re also useful and mind opening for the young ones who have interest in technology and robotics.

<h4>ANIMATRONICS – Luxo Jr at Pixar Place</h4>
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHY5kpGTsDE"> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHY5kpGTsDE </a>
<br>
<p>Animatronics is a term used to describe mechatronic puppets. They’re mainly used in theme parks and animation movies and Pixar has greatly proved how these artificial creatures can become extremely popular. 
Luxo Jr is the famous lamp that appears at every intro of a Pixar movie. Its popularity grew so big that it even became part of Disney’s Hollywood Studios, a theme park in the US. <br>
What I love about this is how technology makes this object “human” and sympathetic, which inspires me in creating something relatable to humans but still unreal.

<h4>CELLULAR AUTOMATA Artworks </h4>

Cellular automata is a system consisted of cells which move within a grid according to their neighbour cells. The atom dynamics evolve through the grid, forming endless options of movement in the space. This technique is often used for artworks or multimedia projects.  <br><br>

       <p>Here in the link above, it’s explained how to apply Cellular Automata into 3D space, and how the rules work. It’s fairly based on “Game of Life”, although it’s upgraded to 3D, while John Conway’s creation was 2D. <br><br>
I find Cellular Automata mesmerizing and extremely eye-catching as it resembles life with its birth, survival and death state of cells’ life. I’d love to try out something in this field, although it looks as complex as fascinating.
