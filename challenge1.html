      <p>After completing the workshop, I started searching for inspirational projects online. Since it wasn’t clear in my mind what direction I wanted my challenge to take, I started looking for diverse topics and project themes: arts, gaming, lifestyle, instructive creations, nature and others. 
</p>

      <h4>ARTIVIVE</h4>
      <p>
Artivive is an Augmented Reality platform for art lovers that aims at changing the way art is looked at, creating an immersive experience with the goal to create a connection between the traditional art and the digital art. <br><br>
The official website is: <a href="https://artivive.com/"> https://artivive.com/ </a> and it contains all the info about their projects, artists and events. <br><br>
They also provide tutorials that can be found on YouTube. One of their videos that particularly grasped my attention  was:
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9StZg6NfJg"> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9StZg6NfJg </a> for the simplicity they used while guiding their viewers through the steps to create AR content. <br><br>
While before I thought AR was “unreachable”, these tutorials offered by Artivive taught me that all you need to know to create some good content, is creativity and some patient to familiarize with tools and interfaces. Moreover, I love the concept behind this art platform, since I’m deeply interested in both traditional and digital arts. 
</p>

   <h4>TILT BRUSH</h4>
   
   <p>Tilt Brush is a VR application by Google that allows its users to paint in 3D space using the surroundings as canvas. The official website of the product is <a href="https://www.tiltbrush.com/"> https://www.tiltbrush.com/</a>, and it offers plenty of tutorials and inspiring videos. <br> One of the tutorial that I found interesting is: 
   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4LO3NXVvh4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4LO3NXVvh4</a>, a clear explanation about the principles of environment painting. What I like about this art solution is that it could completely reshape the way we paint, draw, create.<br> <br> It's an innovative way to express one's creativity and it could redefine the way perople draw and make art. It would be awesome to see how the creations made with Tilt Brush could be used, creating a game maybe?</p>
   
      <br>
   
   <h4>INTER-DREAM</h4>
    
    <p>A finding that completely amazed me was Inter-Dream, a device that induces sleep. The tool combines ambient music with kaleidoscopic visuals controlled by the user’s brainwaves. <br><br>It’s a constant movement of colours, shapes, patterns and it helps relax users’ minds while improving pre-sleeping cognitive states by involving all senses.
In this video, (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBLuf3Pc238">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBLuf3Pc238</a>), a description of Inter-Dream function, while its official page is: <a href="https://pluginhuman.com/art/inter-dream/">https://pluginhuman.com/art/inter-dream/</a>. <br><br> 
What I like about this project is that this tool is able to stimulate brain functions and enhance humans’ lifestyle while being also artsy and aesthetically pleasing. I find dreaming as an interesting subject and would love to create something that connects reality and unconsciousness.

      <h4>	DEMO 1: </h4>
<p> I started off by familiarizing with an AR software called Spark AR. The tool allows to create AR effects for mobile cameras. My first idea was to create a pizza face filter as it sounded easy for a first-time user. 
To create the filter, I first downloaded Face Reference Assets. I then edited a face reference asset on Photoshop by adding a pizza shape and removing the are around the eyes and nose. It was then possible to upload the image into the software and position it on the right place. </p>

<h4>DEMO 2:</h4>
 <p>
I wanted to boost my skills in the previously used software, Spark AR Studio, thus I looked for a way to create an interactive filter that would be also fun to use. 

The filter consists of a written question (Which HCI teacher are you?) and multiple answers (teacher’s picture). The answers are random and to create the experience I used the Patch Editor section, which required quite some time and a lot of tutorial-watching. 

I enjoyed incorporating a fun element into my demo, and it inspired me to create something fun for the next tinkering stages as well.</p>

<h4>DEMO 3: </h4>
<p>For this demo I decided to change software and I went for A-Frame, which was also used during the workshop. I created a pizza shape and placed it in the middle. I tinkered a bit with the sky tag changing images and colours around my main shape and changed some settings to familiarize with the tool as much as possible. I then decided to go one step forward and create my final challenge starting from this demo.

<p> My challenge contains all my biggest passions: pizza, pizza and pizza. I started off by creating the pizza shape with a cylinder and its crust with a ring shape. I then added texture to it and made the “sky” a real pizza oven environment. On the top of the screen there are two ingredients: tomato and mozzarella. When you hover on them, you can add the ingredients to the pizza. 
                                         
                                         <br>                                         
    <a target="_blank" href="images/challenge1/pizzacode2.png">   <img src="images/challenge1/pizzacode2.png" height="200" > </a>
                                         <br>
                                                               
                                          


The experience I created contains the playful and fun element, but it also shows a different perspective, that can’t be experienced in real life. Through this VR experience, people can empathize with pizza and see the “world” (their environment) from a more closed-up view. Moreover, the challenge gives its users the freedom to play and choose what ingredient they want on the pizza. Isn’t that too much fun?
 :D
 More ingredients can be added, but that will come with new updates. (Of course, pineapple isn’t going to be an option)

<p> AR VR technologies are reshaping the way humans see the world in all its aspects: arts, medicine, lifestyle and instruction, by adding engaging and interesting features to the world we already know, resulting in a whole new unique way of experiencing life. I believe both AR and VR are changing the world for the better, allowing people to go beyond their creativity limits and to explore customizable and interactive worlds that can be fed by our own imagination. 
What is real and what is unreal? Well, I think nowadays, with the latest innovations in AR and VR, we can easily say that nothing is unreal anymore, while everything can be possible and real as long as users experience it. I like to think that AR and VR will enhance everyone’s lives and help fighting depression, loneliness, boredom by creating worlds where the user’s view is the only perspective that really matters.
        </p>

<p>
I start off by saying that I’m a complete noob with programming and it often frustrates me not being able to transfer what I have on my mind into codes. However, I found it engaging to create something simple yet playful and dynamic. 
My final concept represents what I most like about VR: the non-human perspective. In the experience I created, you’re a tiny creature inside an oven who can throw some mozzarella and tomato at the pizza, while exploring the insides of an oven, which is something new for me, as human. Pizza world could be a whole new concept and I’m already thinking of multiple new ways and settings I want to create based on this game as I love seeing how different the world is when you’re a new kind of entity. </p>

<p>
Learning, tinkering and creating experiences with A-Frame was very time consuming and frustrating especially in the first stages. But over the time, when I finally familiarize with its language, it became more natural to me and it became fun and engaging. I surely want to learn Unity and Unreal, to be able to compare the three software and see how different the outcomes could be when using different tools with different languages. What I found tough while working with A-Frame, is the fact that documentation and tutorials are very difficult to find, which sets limits to the possibilities one can take when designing.
Other than A-Frame, I used Spark AR during my tinkering phase, and it was an amazing experience for the simplicity of its interface and for the diverse functionalities that it provides its users with. </p>

<p>
Overall, I had a lot fun using this software and what I learnt from it is that knowledge and skills are essential, yes, but creativities and ideas are the most valuable requirements when it comes to create AR and VR content. In other words, while working on this challenge I finally realized that regardless my skill level, I can create a fun and good-looking experience and it motivated in a way that I’m not looking forward to to boosting my abilities in this field.
