      <p>After completing the workshop, I started searching for inspirational projects online. Since it wasn’t clear in my mind what direction I wanted my challenge to take, I started looking for diverse topics and project themes: arts, gaming, lifestyle, instructive creations, nature and others. 
</p>

      <h4>ARTIVIVE</h4>
      <p>
Artivive is an Augmented Reality platform for art lovers that aims at changing the way art is looked at, creating an immersive experience with the goal to create a connection between the traditional art and the digital art. <br><br>
The official website is: <a href="https://artivive.com/"> https://artivive.com/ </a> and it contains all the info about their projects, artists and events. <br><br>
They also provide tutorials that can be found on YouTube. One of their videos that particularly grasped my attention  was:
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9StZg6NfJg"> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9StZg6NfJg </a> for the simplicity they used while guiding their viewers through the steps to create AR content. <br><br>
While before I thought AR was “unreachable”, these tutorials offered by Artivive taught me that all you need to know to create some good content, is creativity and some patient to familiarize with tools and interfaces. Moreover, I love the concept behind this art platform, since I’m deeply interested in both traditional and digital arts.

   <h4>TILT BRUSH</h4>
   
   <p>Tilt Brush is a VR application by Google that allows its users to paint in 3D space using the surroundings as canvas. The official website of the product is <a href="https://www.tiltbrush.com/"> https://www.tiltbrush.com/</a>, and it offers plenty of tutorials and inspiring videos. <br> One of the tutorial that I found interesting is: 
   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4LO3NXVvh4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4LO3NXVvh4</a>, a clear explanation about the principles of environment painting. What I like about this art solution is that it could completely reshape the way we paint, draw, create.<br> <br> It's an innovative way to express one's creativity and it could redefine the way perople draw and make art. It would be awesome to see how the creations made with Tilt Brush could be used, creating a game maybe?</p>
   
      <br>
   
   <h4>INTER-DREAM</h4>
    
    <p>A finding that completely amazed me was Inter-Dream, a device that induces sleep. The tool combines ambient music with kaleidoscopic visuals controlled by the user’s brainwaves. <br><br>It’s a constant movement of colours, shapes, patterns and it helps relax users’ minds while improving pre-sleeping cognitive states by involving all senses.
In this video, (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBLuf3Pc238">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBLuf3Pc238</a>), a description of Inter-Dream function, while its official page is: <a href="https://pluginhuman.com/art/inter-dream/">https://pluginhuman.com/art/inter-dream/</a>. <br><br> 
What I like about this project is that this tool is able to stimulate brain functions and enhance humans’ lifestyle while being also artsy and aesthetically pleasing. I find dreaming as an interesting subject and would love to create something that connects reality and unconsciousness.

      <h4>	DEMO 1: </h4>
<p> I started off by familiarizing with an AR software called Spark AR. The tool allows to create AR effects for mobile cameras. My first idea was to create a pizza face filter as it sounded easy for a first-time user. 
To create the filter, I first downloaded Face Reference Assets. I then edited a face reference asset on Photoshop by adding a pizza shape and removing the are around the eyes and nose. It was then possible to upload the image into the software and position it on the right place. </p>

<h4>DEMO 2:</h4>
 <p>
I wanted to boost my skills in the previously used software, Spark AR Studio, thus I looked for a way to create an interactive filter that would be also fun to use. 

The filter consists of a written question (Which HCI teacher are you?) and multiple answers (teacher’s picture). The answers are random and to create the experience I used the Patch Editor section, which required quite some time and a lot of tutorial-watching. 

I enjoyed incorporating a fun element into my demo, and it inspired me to create something fun for the next tinkering stages as well.</p>

<h4>DEMO 3: </h4>
<p>For this demo I decided to change software and I went for A-Frame, which was also used during the workshop. I created a pizza shape and placed it in the middle.
