      <h2>UNREAL</h2>
      <p>The first tutorial was meant for us students to familiarize with the software. We started off by adding texture to a banana-shaped object and placing it in the space. </p>

              <img src="images/workshop1/banana%202.png" height="300" > 
              <br><br>
              <p>One of the main focus in this tutorial for beginner was to understand how to assign texture and getting used to the interface. The tutorial gave a general idea on where to find essential commands. </p>
        <img src="images/workshop1/banana%20texture.png" height="300" > 
<p>
Secondly, we followed a tutorial that explained how to incorporate blueprints and how to use them. 
</p>
        <img src="images/workshop1/tutorial2.png" height="300" >
        
        <p> First step was to create binding, as shown in the picture below: </p>
        
        <img src="images/workshop1/tutorial2%201.2create%20bindings.png" height="300" >
        
        <p>Next step was to set an event for Moveforward and Moveright:</p>
        
                <img src="images/workshop1/tutorial2%201.3%20setting%20Event%20graph%20for%20Moveforward%20and%20Moveright.png" height="300" >
        <p>Then we had to place items in our space:</p>
        
                <img src="images/workshop1/tutorial2%201.4%20Placing%20item.png" height="300" >
        
        <p>At this point, it's essential to make sure objects are obstacles to the user. Then the game is done.</p>

      <h2>AFRAME</h2>
      <p>In the first part of this tutorial we had to understand what A-Frame is and how it differs from Unreal, which we used in the first part of the workshop. <br><br>
      We started placing shapes in the space and tinkering with size, colors, position and other attributes. </p>
      
        <img src="images/workshop1/1.1.png" height="220" >
        <img src="images/workshop1/1.2%20(position%20rotation%20scale%20color).png" height="220" >
    <p>The tutorial provided us with a library in the official A-Frame website, where all shapes were listes, included their attributes.</p>
         <img src="images/workshop1/1.2%20all%20shapes.png" height="220" >
        <img src="images/workshop1/1.4%20code%20shapes.png" height="220" >
    <p>At this point, we learnt how to apply texture to the shapes.</p>

     <img src="images/workshop1/1.6%20(applying%20grass).png" height="220" >
     
     <p>The final part of this workshop was to understand how to animate the A-Frame code by using the JQuery library on JavaScript.</p>

     <p>Amazing outcome:</p>
